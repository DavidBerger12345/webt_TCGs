<h1>Trading Card Games</h1>
    
<h2>How did Trading Card Games come along, and what what about their popularity?</h2>

<p>As you should already know if you've spent some time on this website, the phenomenon of TCGs started with the Release of</p>
<p>of "Magic: The Gathering" in 1993. As it is unclear to say how many people started playing right as it came out it is </p>
<p>however safe to say that by the year 1997 there were approximatly 5 million players around the world. As the years passed it</p>
<p>seemed as though player numbers would increase at a rate of about 1 million new people per year. But this developement came</p>
<p>to a stop in 2001 which is most likely to be the result of the Pokemon TCG which was released 2 Years prior and started </p>
<p>picking up steam in the world of TCGs. The following year yet another new TCG was released in the U.S.A by the name of Yu-Gi-Oh!.</p>
<p>Unlike other TCGs Yu-Gi-Oh! had already established a fanbase in Japan.</p>
<p>In 2020 probably due to a popular Youtuber named Logan Paul more attention is being casted towards the Pokemon TCG. But the reason</p>
<p>for that seems to be because of nothing more than monetary gain when getting really rare cards. </p>
