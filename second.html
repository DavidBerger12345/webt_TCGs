        <h3>What you need</h3>

        <p>Yu-Gi-Oh! also just Yugioh is a card game in which two players attempt to defeat each other by decreasing their opponent's Life Points down to 0 using a collection of monster, spell, and trap cards</p>
        <p>This game not only requires a deck but also some extra items like a coin and a die or something other than dice to keep track of spell tokens</p>
        <p>Its also good to have sleeves for your cards so they dont get damaged and are more durable the same goes for a gaming mat</p>
        <p>A calculator or a smartphone app to keep track of the Life Points would also be necessity but it still isnt required</p>
        <p>There are 3 kinds of Decks. The main Deck , the extra Deck and the side Deck. You must have a main Deck but the other two are optional</p>
        <p>The main Deck is where the cards are with which you battle your opponent and it also must have at least 40 cards or maximum of 60</p>
        <p>The extra and slide Deck can both have up to 15 cards or none. The extra Deck is used for special monster and the slide one is used for changing cards after games</p>

        <h3>Game Zones</h3>

        <p>Normal Monsters, Effect Monsters, Synchro Monsters, Tuner Monsters, Fusion Monsters, Ritual Monsters, Xyz-Monster, Pendulum Monster, Link Monster</p>
        <p>Normal Monsters have no special effects but typically have higher ATK (strength) and DEF (defense) points than Effect Monsters</p>
        <p>Effect Monsters are monsters with special abilities. There are five different types:</p>
        <p>Flip Effect - activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up</p>   
        <p>Continuous Effect - effect is active while monster is face-up in the battlefield and ends when monster is no longer face-up, destroyed or exiled</p>    
        <p>Trigger Effect - activated during a specified time</p>   
        <p>Quick Effect - can be activated whenever, even during an opponent's turn and even from your hand</p>  
        <p>The Extra Deck includes Synchro Monsters which are powerful cards that can be summoned either by a Special Summon or a Synchro Summon</p>
        <p>Tuner Monsters are cards that allow you to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster.These monsters are considered Synchro Material Monsters because they are material cards required to Synchro Summon</p>
        <p>A part of the other monster cards found in your Extra Deck are Fusion Monsters. To summon these cards, you must perform a Fusion Summon.
        <p> Out of the main deck, Ritual Monsters are monster cards that also require a Special Summon called a Ritual Summon. You must have all the required cards together in your hand or in the battlefield</p>
        <p>All extra Deckmonsters have special requirements to be summoned. Pendulum can normaly summoned but you cant use 2 Spell & Trap card Zones</p>
        <p>Link monster need to be summoned with a condition and they need tokens. Normal monster are worth one token.</p>  
        <p>Link monster can never be put face down or defensiv the only have 1 stat and that is ATK. The place where the DEF is supposed to be there is the link amount needed.It also doenst have stars. But Link Markers</p>
        <p>You can only summon one link monster in the Extra Monster Zone but the markers allow you to summon other link monsters in the Monster Card Zone where the markers point</p>
        <p>Usually also the effect of the link monsters invole their marker </p>

        <h3>Spell & Trap Cards</h3>
        <ol>

        </ol>
       
        <p>Normal SPell Cards can only be used once and once its used its sent to the graveyard</p>
        <p>These cards are activated by placing it face-up directly on the Spell & Trap Card Zone or you can place it face-down and wait for some round and it play it whenever you need it in your round</p>
        <p>The specific effect of the spell is described on the card</p>
        <p>The Ritual Spell Card is one of the cards necessary to perform a Ritual Summon. After it is used, it is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
        <p>Continuous Spells are cards that stay in the battlefield and have a lasting, continuous effect on the game. This effect can either be positive for the user or negative for the user's opponent</p>
        <p>These spells can either be destroyed by your opponent or yourself but you cant sent it to the Graveyard without it being destroyed</p>
        <p>Equip Spell Cards are attached to a monster in the field. These spells are continuous in the field, but they can only be attached to one monster</p>
        <p>When this monster is destroyed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field, the Equip Spell is also destroyed. You use Equip Spells to either improve your own monster or immobilize the opponents monster</p>
        <p>Field Spell Cards are special spells that are activated in the Field Card Zone, which is a special area in the battlefield where only Field Spells can be played</p>
        <p>Only one Field Spell can be active from both players and if somebody chooses to activate a new Field Spell, the previous one is destroyed</p>
        <p>You play Field Spell Cards mostly based on what Deck Archtype you play. For Example Like Dark Magician or fire monsters</p>
        <p>Quick-Play Spells are special spells that can be played during any phase of your turn as well as your opponents turn but they need to placed face-down beforehand</p>
        <p>To activate a Normal Trap Card, it must first be set in the field. Normal Traps, like Normal Spells, are single-use and after the effect takes action the card is then sent to the Graveyard</p>
        <p>Before activating any Trap Card you need to wait a turn</p>
        <p>Continuous Traps are great for playing in your own gamestyle. So long as the card stays face-up its effects are continuous, much like a Continuous Spell.</p>
        <p>Upon activation of other Spells or Traps, Counter Trap Cards have the ability to negate the effects of those cards</p>
        <p>That includes also summoning monsters and their effects and many other things the like</p>

            <li>Tribute Summon</li>
            <li>Flip Summon</li>

        <p>Normal Monsters and most Effect Monsters can be summoned simply by playing the card face-up into the battlefield. This is called a Normal Summon.</p>
        <p>To summon monsters with 5 stars or higher, you must perform a Tribute Summon</p>
        <p>A Tribute summon is like the name implies a summon where you tribute a monster (send to the Graveyard) of yours to summon another</p>

        <p>A Flip summon is when you set a monster in face-down in the defense position it is not considered "summoning" but you also cant summon normal and tribute summon other monsters this turn</p>
        <p>Its just normal summon but in flip postion and must wait a turn to flip the card in face-up offense position </p>
        <p>Any monster that can't be Normal Summoned or set up for a Flip Summon has to be played to the field using a Special Summon. This includes Synchro, Fusion, Ritual, Pendulum and Link Summons. </p>
        <p>When you perform a Special Summon, there is no restriction on the initial position of the monster in the battlefield</p>
        <p>You may decide whether you want to face the monster in offense or defense. You can also special summon unlimited unlike a one time summon per turn  like normal and tribute </p>
        <p>You can special summon normal, effect and tribute monsters if their effect allows it </p>

        <h3>Duel Preparation</h3>
        
        <p>Each match in YuGiOh consists of 3 duels in a best-of-3 format. During a duel, each player starts with 8000 Life Points and a winner is declared in one of the following ways:</p>
        <p>If your or your opponent's Life Points reach 0</p>
        <p>If and when it is time to draw a card, you or your opponent is unable to do so</p>
        <p>With a card's special effect</p>
        <p>Surrendering</p>
        <p>Disqualifying by using banned cards. This rule is mostly directed at the tournaments but if its for fun its not a problem</p>
        <p>Before you begin a duel, you must follow these steps:</p>
        <p>Players should shuffle their decks. The opponent also can shuffle your deck or cut it</p>
        <p>Place all decks face-down in their specified Deck Zones</p>
        <p>Players show their side deck to their opponent and count all the cards in each deck</p>
        <p>f this is the first duel, the winner of coin flip/rock-paper-scissors or die role decides which turn they would like in the duel (or the loser of previous duel decides who goes first)</p>
        <p>Draw 5 cards from the top of the Main Deck and begin and if it is your turn draw a card . You beginn your first turn with 6 cards</p>
